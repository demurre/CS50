            <h1>Basketball</h1>
            <p>Basketball is a popular team sport played by two teams of five players each. The objective of the game is
                to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop. The team with the most points at the end
                of the game wins.</p>
            <p>Basic Basketball rules: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Teams: A basketball game is played between two teams, each consisting of five players on the court.
                </li>
                <li>Objective: The objective of the game is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent's
                    hoop and prevent the opposing team from scoring.</li>
                <li>The Court: The game is played on a rectangular court with a hoop at each end. The standard court
                    dimensions are 94 feet in length and 50 feet in width.</li>
                <li>Game Duration: A basketball game is typically divided into four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes in
                    professional games. In lower levels or youth games, the duration may be shorter.</li>
                <li>Starting the Game: The game begins with a jump ball at the center of the court. The referee tosses
                    the ball up, and one player from each team tries to gain possession.</li>
                <li>Dribbling: A player must bounce the ball on the floor using one hand while moving. If a player stops
                    dribbling or uses both hands, it's called a double dribble, which is a violation.</li>
                <li>Shooting: Players score points by shooting the ball into the opponent's hoop. A made shot inside the
                    three-point line is worth two points, and a shot from beyond the three-point line is worth three
                    points.</li>
                <li>Free Throws: When a player is fouled during the act of shooting or when a team commits a certain
                    number of fouls in a quarter, the fouled player gets to take free throws. Each successful free throw
                    is worth one point.</li>
                <li>Fouls: A foul occurs when a player makes illegal contact with an opponent. Common fouls include
                    pushing, holding, and tripping. If a player commits too many fouls, they may be disqualified from
                    the game.</li>
                <li>Violations: Violations are rule infractions that do not involve contact with an opponent. Examples
                    of violations include traveling (taking more than two steps without dribbling) and stepping out of
                    bounds.</li>
                <li>Timeouts: Each team is allowed a certain number of timeouts during a game to strategize and rest. In
                    professional games, teams usually have multiple timeouts per half.</li>
                <li>Overtime: If the game is tied at the end of regulation time, additional time called overtime is
                    played. The length of overtime varies depending on the level of play.</li>
